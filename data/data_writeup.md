# Emerging Cetegories

Preliminarily reading through the tweets yielded some natural categories which began to emerge. The following are the main categories identified:
- Tutor Recruitment
- Advertising Tutoring
- Informative Tweets
  - Statistics about tutoring in the district
  - Individual stories of a tutor's experience
    - Faculty
    - Student
  - Tutor scheduling

## Common Themes

- Most of the tweets have images alongside them
- Districts will often copy and paste the same exact tweet multiple times (especially prevalent in the tutor recruitment tweets), changing only one or two characters (generally dates)
- A large portion of the tweets are actually retweets from other accounts, not the district's own original tweet
- There is varience in intended audience; some tweets directly address the student, while others are directed toward parents

## Recruitment

Generally, tweets in this category advertise available tutoring positions within the district. Some of these positions are paid, while others are strictly looking for volunteers. It is difficult to discern the recuitment's target audience since qualifications are not posted within the tweet, but might be linked externally. 

> - "RT @CLEvolunteers: Reading! We are currently recruiting #volunteer to serve as #literacy tutors in @CLEMetroSchools &amp; @euclidschools \n@AARP\u2026"
> - "AVID tutors needed\u2014 $10/hr. Read web article for qualifications.... http://t.co/SBe6vO3wjX"
> - "D62 Seeks Reading Tutors\n\nSchool District 62 seeks volunteers (50+) who could spend one hour a week during the... http://t.co/58xr50Hz"

## Advertising Tutoring

Tweets in this category are aimed at informing the reader about opportunities to recieve tutoring. These tweets vary in target audience, with some directly addressing the student, while others ask if the reader's child is struggling. 

> - "RT @PierceCoLibrary: Confused by calculus? Struggling with science? Access professional tutors FREE with your Pierce County Library card...\u2026"
> - "Free tutoring is available for LRSD students http://ow.ly/2zleE",
> - "Does your child struggle with reading, writing or math? Consider attending the Struggling Readers Symposium 12:30-4 pm on October 21. There will be an opportunity for you to ask your questions to reading tutors, teachers, education therapists and neuropsychologists. https://t.co/kpZdRofIdK"

## Informative Tweets

Within this category of tweets, there are three sub-categories: statistics, stories, and scheduling

### Statistics

Many tweets serve to inform the reader about some aspect of statistics of tutoring in the district. There are not many of these type of tweets, and sometimes they are also aimed at recruiting tutors as well

> - "RT @CLEvolunteers: Did you know we tutored 891 @CLEMetroschools students last school year? Want to tutor? 216-391-9500 x 119. #aarpexperien\u2026",
> - "RT @DianaFedderman: Training over 200 volunteers to tutor Ss this summer.  So excited for this new partnership! @561Sdpbc @amitychandler ht\u2026"
> - "RT @0093River: Out of 128 Tutoring students...only 7 students did not make gains!!!! River Hall Elementary is ALL about our data!!! #TakeOw\u2026"

### Stories

Many tweets tell of an individual's story of someone who was a tutor/performed tutoring. This might be a student (in a graduation announcement) or a faculty member. These tweets shout out individuals within the district

> - "Longtime CSA tutor Betsy Sampliner receives a Most Treasured Volunteer award from Center for Community Solutions. https://t.co/TNFZ61Fmze https://t.co/rwEHaBiSX7"
> - "Ivey Colligan, known as \"Miss Ivey,\" strives to make students smile every day at Orchard View Elementary \ud83d\udc90\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udf1f She hasn't missed a day of work in five years, tutors students on weekends, and is now the District's School-Related Employee of the Year.

### Scheduling

The last categoy of information tweets are those which serve to inform the reader about tutoring opportunities. These tweets generally include information about when and where to recieve tutoring or information about cancelled tutoring sessions. These might come alone or as a part of a larger announcement with other logistical information as well. 

> - "RT @VarsityLakesMS: All after school activities have been cancelled. This includes the soccer game, NJHS dance, Step Team practice, and tut\u2026"
> - "Today, PALS Peer Tutoring(12:10-1 PM), Cooking Club (3:30-4:30 PM), & Journalism Club (12:10-1 PM) meet at Plainfield.""What's happening at Algonquin? \n7:30 AM, 8th grade photo retakes\n3 PM, AST, Newspaper Club, Tutors & Computers, Girls V-Ball vs Lincoln"
